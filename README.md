###Description
This repo contains my solution for the course project of [Getting and Cleaning data course](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-011/).

###Content
#####run_analysis.R
######Description
Using this [data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) as input, this script does the following:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. Finally, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

######Usage
